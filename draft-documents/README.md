Once you have proceeded through initial drafts, please lock any versions of your document in Google docs or elsewhere, and transfer your first draft here, to this Github folder, preferably as a MD document. (If you're unable to do so, an alternative is to contact Shannon with your final Doc, and he can get it transferred into MD.) From there, all continuing work should be done with the Github document as the master copy.

**Table Columns**

_Title_ may not be the proper name, but hopefully identifies what's what; feel free to update!

_Lead_ is the main editor who is overseeing the development of the paper

_Status_ are:
* **Drafting** - Paper is being written/edited by authors
* **First Draft** - Authors have sent a complete, consensus draft to editor
* **Edited Draft** - Editor has sent a polished draft to authors
* **Approved Draft** - Authors have OKed edited draft (and made any additional changes)
* **Layout** - Approved draft is being laid out
* **Pictures** - Pictures are being created
* **Pretty Draft** - Approved draft has been turned into a pretty doc and sent to authors for final approval
* **Published** - Article has been published to Github

_Agent_ is who currently has "control" of the master copy of the document, and is making changes

_Link_ is where to find the paper when it's finished

Sorry if any of this is overly bureaucratic. If any of the process doesn't work for you, just let me know. It was tough work getting all the papers finished last time, and I'm trying to streamline and organize that! But, my goal is also to make things easy for you and to help you produce the paper (or spec) that you envision! -Shannon (shannona@skotos.net)
